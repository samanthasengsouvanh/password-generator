Password Generator
My motivation to create this project was the importance of my own data security. I wanted to provide a way for users to create secure passwords to prevent the vulnerability of a security breach. By using the password generator, it resolves the issue of creating "easy" to decipher passwords. In creating this project, I learned the more intricate password you have, the more secure your data will be.

Getting Started
The application should validate user input and ensure that at least one character type is selected.
Once all prompts are answered, the user will be presented with a password matching the answered prompts.
